                <h5 itemprop="headline"><a>What is Visual Programming?</a></h5>
                <p><strong><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/glossary/what-is-visual-programming/">Visual
                      Programming</a></strong> is a type of programming language that enables humans describe
                  processes(usually computer processes) using illustrations, that resemble flowcharts. The illustrations
                  describe a logical flow of executions of a program from start to finish.
                  Unlike a text-based programming language, whose primary purpose is to get the programmer to think like
                  a computer, a visual programming language gives the programmer the ability
                  to write a program in a manner that will make sense to a human being. The logical processes tend to
                  simplify the programming language, making it easier to follow through.
                </p>
                <h5 itemprop="headline"><a>Visual Programming and BIM Software</a></h5>
                <p>BIM Software <strong><a href="https://www.letsbuild.com/blog/a-history-of-bim">has evolved throughout
                      the years</a></strong> and with every emerging technology such as Visual Programming.
                  The main purpose behind visual programming in BIM was to provide a platform for BIM users of all
                  shapes and form (i.e.beginners, experienced), where they could be able to explore ideas that
                  would improve BIM software functionality. It was meant to allow a user to create a program that does a
                  particular job, without ever learning any text-based form of programming.
                  It removes the need to learn text-based programming for BIM users who might not have a programming
                  background and who have no interest in moving towards that direction. Visual Programming
                  within BIM is achieved using several toolkits, the two most common being <strong><a
                      href="https://dynamobim.org/">DynamoBIM</a></strong>

                <h5 itemprop="headline"><a>Understanding the Visual Programming process</a></h5>

                <p>Before we delve any further in setting yourself up with Visual programming, it would be interesting
                  to understand how the entire programming process works. For this example we will talk about
                  Revit and all the tools associated with it. We obviously wouldn't want to go as far back as when Revit
                  started, don't get me wrong, but just to understand the language Revit was built with and
                  how Revit has been extended into Visual Programming.
                </p>

                <div class="post-thumbnail">
                  <img alt="virtual reality" class="img-responsive" src="/img/DR-01.jpg">
                </div>

                <p>Revit is primarily written in the C++ programming language, owing to its benefits such as faster
                  execution time and easy integration with the computer's hardware resources such as the Graphical
                  Processing Unit.
                  C++, also used in video-game programming, gives Revit its 3D Modelling and Rendering capabilities.
                  Without it, it would be difficult to execute 3D modeling tasks as they require a lot of hardware
                  utilization.
                  There are some disadvantages to using C++, which may not be discussed in this forum, but you can get
                  more information here -
                  <strong><a
                      href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-cpp/#:~:text=C%2B%2B%20program%20can't%20support,support%20for%20threads%20built%2Din.">Disadvantages
                      of using C++</a></strong>.
                </p>
                <h6 itemprop="headline"><a>Revit API, SDK & Dynamo</a></h6>

                <p>Now that we have some understanding of the language behind Revit, it makes sense to ask, so how does
                  Visual Programming really work with Revit? Well to answer this question, we will go back to
                  the whole C++ language and how one creates software for an already existing software. Most software,
                  both online in the form of web applications, and offline in the form of desktop applications etc,
                  usually have
                  what we call a <strong><a href="https://clevertap.com/blog/what-is-an-sdk/">Standard Development
                      Kit</a></strong> or SDK. This SDK has a set of tools or in programming terminology, "libraries"
                  that can be borrowed from time to time to execute a specific task.
                  This libraries act as a form of connection or "interface" to the original language with which the
                  software was built. In our case, we have C++ as the base language, and for the libraries, we have
                  a set of other languages such as C#, Python, VB.NET, and Ruby. The availability of a Standard
                  Development Kit give birth to what we call an
                  <strong><a
                      href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-are-application-programming-interfaces">Application
                      Programming Interface</a></strong> or API in short.
                </p>

                  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yzx7ihtCGBs"></iframe>
                </div>
                <br>

                <p>It definitely feels like we have gone too deep in this, but trust me, understanding how this whole
                  setup works is crucial for your success with Dynamo. Let me continue and try my best to shed light
                  on this. Don't worry, alittle programming knowledge won't hurt!
                </p>

                <p>So there we have it. We now know the base language - C++, and we also now know the languages used to
                  connect to the base language, C#, Python, VB.NET and Ruby. We are now also aware of the
                  libraries or Standard Development Kit, developed for this connecting languages. So where is Dynamo in
                  all this? Fear not, we are getting there. I just need to get you to see how all this information
                  connects
                  in the long run.
                </p>
                <h6 itemprop="headline"><a>Visual Programming - A specialized Interface tool</a></h6>
                <p>Most newbies and experienced BIM Revit users would shy away from the idea of programming, owing to
                  its complexity and that learning programming would be too much of a hassle.
                  The Standard Development Kit was developed for programmers to create additional functionality and
                  increase Revit's capabilities. This meant that those who would want to do the same
                  but did not have the required programming skills, were easily locked out from doing so. In comes
                  Visual programming, and that's where things got interesting. Visual programming gives the
                  non-programmer the ability
                  to create software just like a programmer would. To achieve this, the user would install a tool such
                  as Dynamo onto Revit, allowing them to be able to create Visual programming scripts or short codes.
                  This tool, Dynamo, has the capabilities of interacting with the Revit API and SDK in a manner similar
                  to what a programmer would do. Its simply a bridge between the user and the SDK libraries and
                  tools.

                <h6 itemprop="headline"><a>Dynamo Packages - You need them!</a></h6>
                <p>Dynamo is an open source visual programming platform, allowing both programmers and non-programmers
                  to create their own libraries and tools that can be shared with others. There are currently
                  a number of useful, ready-to-go tools <strong><a
                      href="https://www.tabnine.com/blog/what-is-visual-scripting/">(visual scripts)</a></strong>, that
                  have already been created by other people that you
                  can use repeatedly in your projects. Most of these tools are accessible via what we call <strong><a
                      href="https://primer.dynamobim.org/11_Packages/11-1_Introduction.html">Dynamo
                      Packages</a></strong>.
                  The biggest advantage of using these tools is the time-saving aspect, as most of these Dynamo Packages
                  are likely to have the tools that you are looking for.
