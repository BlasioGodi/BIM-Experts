                <h5><a>Virtual Reality</a></h5>
                <p>As the world continuously gears itself to an ever-changing technological environment, 
                  <strong><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/virtual-reality">Virtual Reality</a></strong> stands out as a platform that aims to revolutionize industries across the
                  world. Virtual Reality, a term limited to the use of computers, is an alternate reality that is similar to the reality or real world that we experience on a day to day basis. Virtual Reality,
                  an alternate environment, enables users to engage in unlimited imagination that is not bound to real life constraints such as the force of gravity, wind e.t.c. Virtual Reality
                  enables users to create their own worlds that can suite them. A world where anything is possible. The flexibility and growing potential of virtual reality has led to a steady increase
                  in the use of this technology ever since its inception, leading to its application in various industries, from the Architectural Engineering and Construction Industry, to the Education
                  sector, and all the way down to the creation of Games and recreational activities such as museums. The application of this technology has proved to be broad, encompassing all
                  areas of our waking life.</p> 

                <h5><a>Augmented Reality</a></h5>
                <p>Whatever you can see, feel and touch, is your reality. What if it was possible to add objects/elements into your reality, cutting out the aspect of being able to feel and touch
                  them, but at the same time still see them? This is Augmented Reality. <strong><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/augmented-reality-AR#:~:text=Augmented%20reality%20(AR)%20is%20the,overlaid%20on%20top%20of%20it.">
                  Augmented Reality</a></strong>, as the term suggests, is changing the current reality 
                  that we can see, feel and touch but including virtual objects/elements that were not there before. In AR systems, the user views the local real-world environment, 
                  but the system augments that view with virtual objects.

                <h5><a>Robots set to replace humans</a></h5>

                <p>AI is geared towards creating robots that will think and act like human beings. Though this is still widely being discussed as to how "intelligent" they should be, it is quite
                  obvious that most tasks that seem repetitive and redudant will be given over to robots to perform. It is already common to find robots taking over certain manufacturing and assembly processes where 
                  human minds may easily get tired and distracted from repetitive processes. In his book, <strong><a href="https://www.uc.pt/feuc/citcoimbra/Martin_Ford-Rise_of_the_Robots">
                  Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future</a></strong>, 
                  <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ford_(author)">Martin Ford</a></strong> 
                  discusses how software algorithms and robots will be replacing lower paying jobs such as fast food attendants as well as higher paying jobs such as writers and legal professionals. 
                  What patterns are you seeing in your own industry? What place might robots and algorithms eventually have in the office and in the field?
                </p>

                <p>The question still remains. How far can a robot or an algorithm go when it comes to building design and construction? Will robots play the role of "builder", and will building designs
                  be created by simply running an intelligent "application", backed by a machine learning algorithm? Currently, robots do not build buildings but there does exist the capability of leveraging on 
                  software algorithms to be able to create intelligent and optimized building designs. Software such as Revit has a tool called Dynamo, a visual programming tool that creates these algorithms. If
                  you haven’t jumped on the Dynamo bandwagon yet, you need to.
                </p>

                <h5><a>Parametric Design and Algorithmic Thinking</a></h5>

                <p><strong><a href="https://primer.dynamobim.org/01_Introduction/1-2_what_is_dynamo.html">Dynamo</a></strong> and other visual programming tools such as 
                  <strong><a href="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/page/tutorials-1">Grasshopper</a></strong>, are taking us into a future where it will be possible to explore multiple iterations of a conceptual building design,
                  and in turn, enabling us to explore the "most optimized" design that suits the needs of the client. This will save on alot of time, seeing that the conceptual design options can be assessed
                  one after the other by simply changing parameter values (hence the name <strong><a href="https://parametric-architecture.com/what-is-parametric-design-in-architecture/">Parametric design</a></strong>).
                  If the client says the building needs to be abit higher, changing this will be as simple as adding an extra floor number within the visual programming tool. 
                  <strong><a href="https://equip.learning.com/computational-thinking-algorithmic-thinking-design-thinking">Algorithmic thinking</a></strong>  will also ease
                  redundant design calculations by engineers, and will also enable teams to experience realtime design updates as the different parameters are created and entered. If you are new to visual 
                  programming and need to get started, please check out

                <h5><a>Virtual and Augmented Reality</a></h5>

                <p>The world of VR and AR can't be overlooked when talking about the future of BIM. It is proposed to have the biggest impact as it will form a bridge between our physical world and
                  the virtual computerized world. Ever imagined what it would be like to step into your residential house or commercial building project? For the most part of our building projects, majority of our
                  interactions with designs and plans has been through a computer interface i.e. monitors. The next frontier will be to step into these designs and experience them. Not only is this set to 
                  make design experience involving for the designer but also interactive for the client. If the client can step into their design and quickly pick up problems such as, "Why is my ceiling so low?",
                  then this would make it easier for the designer to make alterations that would have otherwise been picked up on the construction site. Augmented Reality, on the other hand, will mostly utilize
                  devices that will merge the virtual building models with our real world. Check out 
                  <strong><a href="">Virtual & Augmented Reality in Construction</a></strong> for more information.
                </p>

                <p>The two platforms will also be used to collaborate on projects. With the internet connecting people from around the world, Virtual Reality is also set to connect different
                  consultants working on the same project. The video below, by <strong><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/holodeck/">Nvidia</a></strong> , 
                  will highlight more on this.

                <h5><a>Digital Twins & the Internet of Things (IOT)</a></h5>

                <p>A <strong><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin">digital twin</a></strong>, as describe by IBM, is a virtual model designed to accurately reflect a physical object. 
                  The object being studied - for example, a wind turbine - is outfitted with various sensors related to vital areas of functionality. These sensors produce data about different aspects of the 
                  physical object's performance, such as energy output, temperature, weather conditions and more. This data is then relayed to a processing system and applied to the digital copy. 
                  So how does this apply to BIM and building projects?
                </p>

                <p>BIM models and assets within the model i.e. electrical equipment, furniture, mechanical equipment etc, represent the virtual model as described above. At the end of the construction project, it is expected
                  that the virtual models (<strong><a href="https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/As-built_or_as-constructed_building_information_model">As-built Model</a></strong>) will be an accurate representation of the 
                  physical building project. The As-built model will be handed over to the client team responsible for operation and maintenance. Merging the two, i.e. the BIM model and the physical building will involve the use of digital twins. The building assets, 
                  electrical and mechanical equipment, will be fitted with sensors that will allow for a direct connection back to the BIM model. This information will also be available to the manufacturer's of the installed assets.
                  In the event of equipment failure or significant drop in performance, the sensors will communicate this information to those responsible for operation and maintenance via a tool such as a Building Management System (BMS). 
                  They will then be prompted to send this data directly to the manufacturer, who will in turn arrange for repairs or part replacement. This mode of seamless communication is made possible by Digital Twins and the
